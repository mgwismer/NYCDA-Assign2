    Margaret received her electrical engineering degree in 1986 and has spent the ensuing years working as an industrial field engineer, conducting funded research projects and training electrical engineers in electronic design and power and control systems. One of her first programming languages was PASCAL and then Fortran. Throughout her career she has pursued an interest in algorithms and coding for its potential to offer answers to seemingly intractable problems.  Between the years 2007 and 2010 she coded a physical model to determine how sound reaches the inner the ear. The project was worked on jointly by groups from Creare Research Labs and from the University of Illinois. Over the past twenty years she has brought her experiences from both basic research and practical system design and operation to the classroom to emphasize theoretical concepts and problem solving techniques.

    Currently Margaret is enrolled in a web-intensive development bootcamp as she updates her coding repertoire and learns how to leverage the depth and breadth of the web to solve problems both technical and otherwise. Margaretâ€™s core skills are based in mathematics, physical modeling and algorithm design. She has traveled to different parts of the world including Europe and the Far East for both personal and professional reasons in addition to camping with her family throughout the US. She writes creative fiction and non-fiction as a hobby and has finally deigned to put some of her musings on family, technology, parenting and travel online.
